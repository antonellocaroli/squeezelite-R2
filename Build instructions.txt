Dependencies

Squeezelite-R2 requires header files for the following libraries to be present at 
build time: * libasound2 * libflac * libmad0 * libvorbis * libfaad * libmpg123

All above libraries are dynamically loaded and optional at runtime, meaning that 
these libraries are only required on the build machine.

It also optionally supports the following libraries which may be enabled by 
defining additional build options: * libsoxr * libffmpeg

/include and /Include-osx contains all the headers (dev-version) needed to produce 
linux debian minimal and osx versions.

To build for osx you need a valid version of portaudio.a (static library) tobe 
in ./lib_osx folder.

See squeezelite.vcxproj for dependencies in Windows.

You should provide headers and statics libraries as needed by other platform 
specific builds.

Build Options

Optional build options are enabled by passing additional defines to the compiler. 
This may be done with the -D option to ggc or via setting OPTS before calling the 
included makefiles. For example:

OPTS="-DFFMPEG -DRESAMPLE" make

The following build options are supported:

* PORTAUDIO - build with port audio support (on linux only, it is not optional on other platforms) 
* RESAMPLE - build with libsoxr support for real time upsampling 
* FFMPEG - build with FFMPEG support for wma and alac support. Note that this requires the binary to be run 
with FFMPEG library versions which match the header files used for compilation. 
This is necessary and the ffmpeg api changes between versions. 
* VISEXPORT - support export of audio data to jivelite for visualization support (linux only) 
* DSD - support of DSD playback via 'natives' formats when possible or DOP.  

Target Platforms

Squeezelite-R2 can builds on debian linux, osx using included makefiles:

- Makefile.minimal
- Makefile.osx

It also builds using MSVC++ on Windows (squeezelite.vcxproj).

Above versions are distributed also in binary forms, see attachment to releases.

- Makefile.pa
- Makefile.resample

are just example on how to enable additiona features in linux

Other Makefiles are provvided and tested by different users, they worked when added, 
but are not tested by me on every new releases, so they should work but may not.

- Makefile.debian-i386
- Makefile.debian-x86-64
- Makefile.gentoo
- Makefile.freebsd
- Makefile.rpi
- Makefile.osx-i386
- Makefile.osx-ppc
- Makefile.osx-ppc64
- Makefile.osx-x86_64

please reports errors, or new you wish to add, using issues in gitHub.

To produce your own makefile, set options and flags for your platform, specify 
the executable name and include Makefile.

To build on linux with support i.e for resampling if the same tree was previously 
used to build with different options:

OPTS=-DRESAMPLE make clean

OPTS=-DRESAMPLE make
